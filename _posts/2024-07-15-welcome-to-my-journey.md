Hi, I'm Lara! I'm excited to start this new journey with you. I come from a strong background in computer science, tech consulting, and communication training, and I have a lot of formative experiences that have shaped my path. I even used to be an Audio Engineer pre-2020. As I began my journey into computing post 2020 and started studying at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) for a Masters in Computer Science, I encountered a book called "Your Computer Is on Fire," by Mar Hicks, Kavita Philip, Benjamin Peters, and Thomas S. Mullaney, taught by Dr. Hood. This book takes an intersectional approach, examining how different social categories and systemic issues overlap and impact the field of technology. Throughout  my work in the class and after getting a chance to hear from Mar Hicks themselves, the book has become a guiding light for me.

### A Bit About My Background

"Your Computer Is on Fire," was my introduction to computer science during my graduate studies, and its teachings have stuck with me in my work and life. The writers explore deep-rooted systemic issues, associated with Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) while diving into foundational problems underlying our systems. One important chapter by Mar Hicks, explores their award-winning book, *Programmed Inequality: How Britain Discarded Women Technologists and Lost Its Edge In Computing*. Hicks investigates "why the proportion of women declined as electronic computing matured, and how this labor situation had grave effects on the technological aspirations of that waning superpower. It shows what lessons this holds for other nations, especially the United States, and how history can help us make sense of the present and the future by focusing not just on technological success stories, but also stories of technological failure."

### My Journey in Tech Consulting
Over the past year, Iâ€™ve worked in tech consulting with some incredible colleagues who are giants in cloud computing DevOps, and to me, improving developer experiences. What I appreciated most was their ability to step back, address problems honestly, and offer solutions. Their expertise and passion for bettering the tech world were inspiring, and I learned immensely from them.

Through my work on various projectsâ€”developing GitHub training modules, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, developing a DevOps questionnaire for clients work, and managing large-scale repository migrations, among the few diverse experiences as a consult I hadâ€”I gained valuable experience in enhancing developer proficiency and workflow efficiency. These experiences have deepened my understanding of sustainable practices and the importance of clear, honest communication in tech, but my goal personally was to add the "love" on top. I know how good I was able to hear out people's problems and see where they needed to go. While I am constantly building on my skills as a developer, I think this is where I loved to help. Engaging in positive conversations and then diving deep as possible so that this other person feels that care. And that was energy I put into internal and client work. I want to continue to carry that deeper and deeper as I build on my career. I feel like my mentors were great proponents of this.

### Why I Do What I Do

As someone who grew up with technology, Iâ€™ve observed its impact on our global experience and made conscious decisions around my interactions with it. I have heard the chatter through years of random jobs, working in audio, recording music, living around creatives for years,working on consulting. I feel a common thread of struggle through all of us we are commonly facing that is bigger than our day to day work. We struggle carrying this looming pressure and stress into everything we do. It's necessary to make change. But I think people and especially leaders have become complacent and horrible at necessary conversations that they perceive as hard or are acctually difficuly and stifle their own progresss. Finally, conversations in business can often become clouded and discriminatory, which ultimately leads to lost opportunities. I believe in slowing down these conversations, embracing transparency, and fostering a more open culture to create a sustainable future.

My love for developer experience paired with influence from my grandfather's roots as a farmer, drives me to find ways to merge these passions. Iâ€™m deeply interested in sustainability, renewable energy, and creating a better mutual world through tech and agriculture. Iâ€™ve seen the potential in revitalizing the soil and promoting renewable energy, and I want to be part of this change. In a world where about 46% of our rivers and streams have excess nutrients due to agricultural runoff (EPA), we must rethink our approach to sustainability. Starting from the soil, we can revive our practices to create a more beautiful and everflowing future.

Living in Chicago for the past nine years, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of witnessing the vibrant  community life that defines this incredible city seated next to a 22,404 sq mi lake. From the bustling farmers' markets that spring to life with fresh, local produce, to the serene community gardens that offer a slice of nature amidst the urban landscape, I've seen firsthand how these spaces foster connection and nurture a sense of belonging. These experiences have deeply inspired me to contribute to empowering our communities and local growers of literally all sizes.

At 30 years old, and after some experience trying to advocate for ethics in my own work, Iâ€™ve come to understand that creating lasting, impactful change is a journey, not a destination. It requires deep-rooted dedication, patience, and a daily commitment to making a difference. I seek to jump into action and promote sustainability, enhance local food systems, and build stronger, more resilient communities. Every day presents a new opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute, and I am committed to seizing these opportunities to help shape a brighter future for our soil and our cities.

### The Bigger Picture

Beyond my past professional role as a DevOps Engineer, I care deeply about how our conversations and actions in tech affect us all. I believe in slowing down to foster meaningful, honest dialogues that lead to sustainable futures. This holistic approach to tech is something I bring into all my projects.

### Looking Forward

Iâ€™m here to share my journey, projects, and thoughts on sustainable tech and developer experience. From creating a sustainable CI/CD project, working with GCP for farm data, to starting an at-home irrigation system, Iâ€™m exploring ways to integrate tech and sustainability. I want to build, create, and grow, both in my professional life and my personal projects.

### Meet Me in the Garden

Gardening is one of my favorite ways to unwind and connect with nature. Plus, it's a great reminder of the importance of sustainability in every aspect of life. Here's a silly selfie of me after planting an herb in my garden. ðŸŒ¿
