## About Lara Sundare

Hi, I'm Lara! Welcome to my blog where I share my journey in DevOps, tech consulting, and sustainability. I have a strong background in computer science, tech consulting, and communication training, shaped by a variety of formative experiences.

### My Background

I started my career as an Audio Engineer pre-2020. As I began my journey into computing post-2020 and pursued a Master's in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), I encountered the book "Your Computer Is on Fire" by Mar Hicks, Kavita Philip, Benjamin Peters, and Thomas S. Mullaney. Taught by Dr. Hood, this book takes an intersectional approach, examining how different social categories and systemic issues overlap and impact the field of technology. This book has become a guiding light for me in my work and life.

### Professional Journey

Over the past year, I’ve worked in tech consulting with some incredible colleagues who are giants in cloud computing DevOps, and improving developer experiences. I have worked on various projects, including developing GitHub training modules, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, creating a DevOps questionnaire for clients, and managing large-scale repository migrations. These experiences have deepened my understanding of sustainable practices and the importance of clear, honest communication in tech.

### Why I Do What I Do

Growing up with technology, I’ve observed its impact on our global experience and made conscious decisions around my interactions with it. I have heard the common thread of struggle through various jobs, from audio engineering to consulting. We often face pressures and stresses bigger than our day-to-day work. I believe in slowing down conversations, embracing transparency, and fostering a more open culture to create a sustainable future.

My love for developer experience, paired with my grandfather's roots as a farmer, drives me to merge these passions. I’m deeply interested in sustainability, renewable energy, and creating a better world through tech and agriculture. Living in Chicago for the past nine years, I’ve witnessed vibrant community life, from bustling farmers' markets to serene community gardens, and these experiences have inspired me to empower communities and local growers.

### The Bigger Picture

Beyond my professional role as a DevOps Engineer, I care deeply about how our conversations and actions in tech affect us all. I believe in fostering meaningful, honest dialogues that lead to sustainable futures. This holistic approach to tech is something I bring into all my projects.
